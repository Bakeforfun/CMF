Mathematical finance:

Hull - introductory text on derivatives, is ideal for those with a limited background in mathematics.

Bjork - concentrating on the probability theory of continuous arbitrage pricing of financial derivatives.


Finite-difference methods:

Brandimarte - different mathematical models and numerical techniques.


Monte Carlo methods:

Glasserman, Jackel -best books available, more than comprehensive.


All three chapters: 

Wilmott - presents all the current financial theories in a manner designed to make them "easy" to understand (unfortunately not rigorous).
